# Neural Network for AND Logic Operation
This project implements a simple neural network using numpy to learn the AND logic operation. The neural network architecture consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with sigmoid activation, and an output layer with sigmoid activation. Gradient descent is used for optimization.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

# Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the main script
4. Once the training is complete, the script will plot the loss curve and display the predicted outputs for the AND logic operation.
